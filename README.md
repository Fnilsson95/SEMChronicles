### Project Description:

SEMChronicles is a comprehensive online journal and portfolio documenting my journey through the Software Engineering and Management (SEM) program. This project aims to create a detailed repository of all the courses, materials, and projects undertaken throughout my university studies. SEMChronicles will serve as a personal documentation tool, showcasing my academic growth, the skills I acquire, and the various projects I develop. It will include:

- Course Overviews: Summaries and key takeaways from each course.
- Materials & Resources: Notes, reading lists, and references used.
- Project Documentation: Detailed descriptions, code snippets, and outcomes of projects.
- Personal Reflections: Insights, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

SEMChronicles will not only be a valuable resource for future reference but also a portfolio to showcase my knowledge and experience to potential employers and collaborators.
